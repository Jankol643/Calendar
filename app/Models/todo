Separate Model Objects for a Laravel Calendar App
In a Laravel calendar app, there are several different calendar entry objects that can be created as separate models. These models can help organize and manage the different types of calendar entries in the application. Here are some possible calendar entry models:
Event Model: This model can represent individual events on the calendar. It can have attributes such as event name, description, start date, end date, location, and any other relevant information about the event.
Task Model: This model can represent tasks or to-do items that need to be completed. It can have attributes such as task name, description, due date, priority, status, and any other relevant information about the task.
Appointment Model: This model can represent appointments or meetings scheduled on the calendar. It can have attributes such as appointment title, description, start date, end date, location, participants, and any other relevant information about the appointment.
Reminder Model: This model can represent reminders set for specific dates or times. It can have attributes such as reminder title, description, reminder date/time, and any other relevant information about the reminder.
Recurring Event Model: This model can represent events that occur regularly, such as weekly meetings or monthly events. It can have attributes such as event name, description, start date, end date, recurrence pattern, and any other relevant information about the recurring event.
